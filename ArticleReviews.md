## Maximal Feedback Arc Set

In graph theory a feedback arc set (where the word *arc* is also known as edges or links)
is a set of edges that if removed from the graph leave a DAG [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set).
Thus, a maximal feedback arc set trys to identify as many edges for removal from the graph.
